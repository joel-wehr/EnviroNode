# EnviroNode
IoT Environmental Sensor Node (Electric Imp Imp004m/Bosch BME680)

This project will contain all of the necessary information to create an IoT environmental sensor node based on the Bosch BME 680.

 Physical enclosure:
  The initial physical enclosure is a plastic AA battery enclosure with optional wall mount by New Age Enclosures.

    This enclosure will need to be cut/milled to allow proper airflow to the sensor. Preferably, a custom enclosure top would be modeled       to allow 3D printed parts.
    In addition, a complete custom enclosure could be modeled so that all parts, save the battery tabs could be printed. 
    
 PCB Design:
  The PCB design files have been generated in Altium Designer. Gerber files will be available to allow fabrication at most manufactures.
  A Bill Of Materials will be available to purchase parts.
  Gerber files can be used to purchase/cut a stencil for PCB assembly. 
  
  ImpOS software:
  It is the intention of this project to develop a software library for the BME680 sensor that can be submitted to Electric Imp to be included in the list of hardware libraries. Other possibilities include:
    Web console
    Alexa integration
    Mobile app console
    
All constructive ideas for functionality are welcome. Please contact me if interested.
